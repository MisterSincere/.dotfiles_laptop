triangle normals: whats with the triangle normals in the given solution
iplane normals  : no direction check?
box intersection: how many minuspoints for no foremost primitive check and storing wrong ray "length"

group_01:
  - normals: 
    - box correct
    - triangle correct 
    - sphere correct (TODO though the direction check will always be true and is thus not necessary)
    - plane correct (direction check done)
  - refraction:
    - remaining bounces: check
    - correct refraction index: check
    - reverse normal when from inside: ?
    - decide between reflection and refraction: check
  - mirror: correct (slight movement into normal direction is one possibility, you can also just subtract an epsilon value from the length)

group_02:
  - normals:
    - box correct (top normals flipped, but that's not a problem)
    - triangle correct

    - plane correct
  - refraction:
    - remaining bounces: check

group_12:
  - box: no check for foremost primitive
  - normals:
    - box: normals depending directly on ray direction, which box side to choose depends on the ray, but for a box there are 6 sides, which are represented by unit vectors and their negative counterparts.
    - triangle: no normal set
    - sphere: normalization missing and normal direction is inverted

group_14:
  - box: missing check for foremost primitive 
  - normals:
    - box only considering 3 orientations

group_16:
  - nothing... i mean exercise 2 frameworks isn't even there?
  - but no commits for exercise 2 have been pushed

group_17:
  - box: wrong comparison for foremost primitive check and storing as length of ray; should be length 'tin' not a point
  - normals:
    - they did nothing...
  - refraction:
    - remaining bounces: ?
    - correct refraction index: ?
    - reverse normal when from inside: ?
